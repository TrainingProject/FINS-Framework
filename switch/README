Modern networks invalidate many of the assumptions of traditional networking. For example, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) invalidate the assumption that there will be stable routes in the network, throwing traditional routing techniques into disarray. Handheld computing devices, such as the Apple iPhone and devices built around the Google Android platform, further challenge assumptions about platform mobility. Over the last ten years, the need for cross-layer design to meet these new challenges has become cliche. Yet no replacement for the traditional network stack has emerged. Implementing experimental cross-layer approaches on commodity hardware and software remains challenging.

The goal of this project is to build a framework for modular, extensible, experimental, network stack implementation, called the FINS (Flexible Internetwork Stack) Framework. The FINS Framework will initially be implemented on handheld devices and tested and validated in a MANET environment. The framework will allow users to leverage existing protocols where needed, providing implementations of those protocols (such as TCP and IP) that provide more real-time control (by allowing protocol parameter modification) and transparency (through external visibility of layer- specific information) than is available in existing implementations, while allowing users to replace or modify components as desired. Thus, the FINS Framework will allow researchers ready access to the network stack in a manner previously possible only in simulation or by making painstaking operating system kernel modifications (usually in Linux).
